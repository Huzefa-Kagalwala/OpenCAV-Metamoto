### Dependencies
* Eigen3
On Ubuntu, Eigen3 can be installed using apt by running 'sudo apt install libeigen3-dev'. A similar method should work for other Linux distributions. Alternatively, Eigen3 is available for download here: http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/  
Version 3.3.4 is known to work, but other versions may work as well. Both the Makefile and Visual Studio project will locate Eigen3 using the environment variable EIGEN_HOME, if set.
